Near
Real people. Near you.
Near is an experiment in presence.
No swiping.
No endless messaging.
No pressure.
Just real people, in the same place, at the same time.
Why Near exists
Most dating apps optimise for:
attention
dopamine
endless interaction
Near optimises for:
honesty
restraint
being present
One message.
No ghosts.
No games.
How it works
See people physically near you
Send one intentional message
No obligation to reply
Silence is respected
If it happens, it happens.
If it doesn’t, that’s okay too.
Philosophy
Near isn’t about more.
It’s about enough.
Enough courage to say hello.
Enough awareness to be present.
Enough respect to let go.
Status
This project is intentionally simple.
Built in the open.
Evolving slowly.
Staying human.
